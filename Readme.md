Soil Type Classification using Machine Learning

This project aims to classify different soil types based on their physicochemical properties using machine learning. Soil classification plays a vital role in modern agriculture, helping farmers and researchers make informed decisions about crop selection, fertilization, and land management.
The dataset used in this project contains various features like:

- pH level
- Electrical Conductivity (EC)
- Organic Carbon (OC)
- Phosphorous (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Iron (Fe)
- Zinc (Zn)
- Manganese (Mn)
- Copper (Cu)
- Soil Type (Target)

Each row in the dataset corresponds to a soil sample with its measured values. The target variable is a categorical label indicating the soil class.
 
The dataset is assumed to be a CSV file where each row represents a soil sample, and each column is a specific feature or target class. Before feeding the data into the machine learning model, we perform several preprocessing steps. These include checking for missing values and handling them appropriately, encoding categorical target variables using label encoding, and scaling the feature values using standardization techniques. The dataset is then split into training and testing subsets using an 80/20 or 70/30 ratio to evaluate the model’s generalization capabilities.

The Random Forest Classifier is chosen for this project due to its robustness, accuracy, and ability to handle both categorical and numerical data. It is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to provide a stable and accurate classification. Once the model is trained, it is evaluated using various performance metrics including accuracy score, confusion matrix, and a full classification report that covers precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. Additionally, we visualize the feature importances to understand which soil attributes most significantly influence the model’s predictions.

Several Python libraries are utilized in this project. Pandas is used for data manipulation and cleaning; NumPy supports numerical computations; Matplotlib and Seaborn are employed for creating informative visualizations; Scikit-learn (sklearn) is used for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation; Joblib is used to save and load the trained model; and Warnings is used to suppress unnecessary output during runtime. Together, these libraries provide a powerful and flexible environment for building and evaluating machine learning models.

Setup instruction:
To run this project locally, follow these step-by-step instructions. First, clone the repository or download the project files into a working directory. Then, create a virtual environment using the command python -m venv env and activate it using source env/bin/activate for Linux/Mac or env\Scripts\activate for Windows. Next, install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt. Once the environment is set up, launch Jupyter Notebook by typing jupyter notebook in your terminal or command prompt. Open the soil-type-classification.ipynb file and execute each cell in order to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance. Make sure the dataset file (CSV) is in the same directory or modify the notebook path to match the location of your dataset.After training, you can save the model using joblib.dump() and later load it with joblib.load() for prediction on new data. The notebook includes visualizations such as the confusion matrix and feature importance bar plots to give you deeper insights into model performance and decision logic.
